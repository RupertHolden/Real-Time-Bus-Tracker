# Real-Time-Bus-Tracker

This project uses real time data to show bus stops from MIT to Harvard.  The page features a movable map of Boston that can be zoomed in and out, upon clicking the button in the top left corner, "Show stops between MIT and Harvard", the map will show blue points as bus stops.

### How to Run

This is very simple to run.  Open the project and take some time to look around the map. The map will open on Boston with MIT and Harvard both on the page.  Click the "Show stops between MIT and Harvard" to show the different stops between MIT and Harvard.

### Future Improvements

Some future improvements that could be added to thhis tracker could be more stops on the map as well as a live update on traffic.  As Boston is a big city, it would be helpful to see what areas are congested, this change could help the tracker be applicable to people who are driving in the area instead of just bus riders.
